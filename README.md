# Advent-of-Code-2019

In this repo you can find my solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/). 
It's a daily challenge each December where you need to solve puzzles to help Santa deliver his (or her) presents.
Feel free to join and while you're at it show the creator ([Eric Wastel](http://was.tl/)) some love.

Also, if you like to discuss solutions please reach out to me on Twitter: [@stefanjblos](https://twitter.com/stefanjblos)
